                With the development of basic education curriculum in Uganda with inadequate knowledge 
                of course unit of Home Economics since the introduction of formal education in 1886; 
                promotion of quality and potential education that is sustainable has become a milestone
                 among girls in particular; because almost all the homes of both the elites and 
                 illiterates have become equally uneconomically viable.

                   The future of poor children in India living along the street is in darkness.
                    Due to a lack of education these children have stolen loot, have addictions,
                     have gone the way of crime. Because alienating get them from all over the place. 
                     These children need love, happiness, counselling and guidance.

                   Our work is exploding and we need to move our current premises. 
                   A farm will enable us to such as a farm will provide the venue, 
                   space, office and training space we require to continue our services
                    to the children of Limpopo Province. Purchasing a farm is sound financial
                     investment rather than ongoing renting. Through purchasing a farm we will 
                     also be able to generate a steady income for the organization and that means
                      greater sustainability long term and more able to cope with donor delays.

                   The problem is the need for our services has increased significantly.
                    We are now seeing over 2,743 children on a weekly basis.
                     To be in a position to provide ongoing services and generate 
                     ongoing revenue, we have identified purchasing a farm will enable 
                     us to have ongoing camp programing, sufficient office, and storage space, 
                     training, providing food through a camp kitchen, and having an office space. 
                     The option is to rent a property at approximately the same cost as a mortgage monthly.
